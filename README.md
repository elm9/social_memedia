# social_memedia
A full-stack social media app specifically made for sharing memes. 




Have you ever found yourself looking strictly for some amusement on Twitter or Instagram, but you end up having to deal with your friends posting politically charged or incredibly personal things that disrupt from the flow of your entertainment? That's not a problem with SMM. We are creating a dedicated location to share and find the dankest memes on the web. Users can grant a meme-point (name pending) similar to alike, only meme points are kept track on the userâ€™s profile where other users can see along with all of the memes they have posted.
Create an account by entering a unique username, a secret password, and your name. This information will be stored in a MySQL database.
How to add a meme: Click on "Add new meme" button and upload the specific file type (.png, .img, .gif).
Meme Points: upon clicking the "+" button or whatever, the MP count on that post goes up by one. It cannot be clicked multiple times by the same user, but it can be unchecked if they so choose.
Click on a username in the homepage to be taken to that user's meme page, or use a search bar to find that user's meme page.
The meme page will show all the user's uploaded memes along with their meme points.
